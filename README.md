## Welcome to my C++ repository

You will find all my work in C++ organised in different folders :

1. **centrale training** : during my C++ training with centrale sup√©lec course, I worked on different problems. My answers on the different problems are consigned here.
2. **design patterns** : I recently started to work on design patterns to improve both my knowledge in software development and my ease to write C++ code.
